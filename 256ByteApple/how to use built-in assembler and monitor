ctrl-c, enter = leave, leave variables and BASIC program in memory
ctrl-b, enter = leave, zap variables in memory, new BASIC program

4-byte addr, e.g. 1000 = dump byte at addr, follow with return for 8 more
2000.2010 = dump bytes between addrs, ctrl-s = pause, ctrl-x = stop

any lined typed is assembled, unless first char is $

first char: $ monitor command, 

first char blank:  assembled instruction store at next addr

otherwise:  assy instruction
